# Transient electromagnetic (TEM) measurements 2017

This directory contains the transient electromagnetic (TEM) raw data collected at [Viveros de Netzahualcóyotl in Xochimilco](https://goo.gl/maps/K7xEC44MdnQno9CG8) during September 2017. The following table lists the available TEM soundings with different sizes of the square loop.

| Sounding ID | Acquisition date | Loop size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| XOC1-4 | 09/11/2017 | 150 m x 150 m |
| XOC5 | 09/11/2017 | 50 m x 50 m |
| XOC6-9 | 09/12/2017 | 50 m x 50 m |
| VIV1-2 | 09/12/2017 | 300 m x 300 m |

All soundings were collected with a terraTEM manufactured by Monex GeoScope using a single-loop configuration.

Data is provided as binary files *.bin* (terraTEM proprietary format) and universal sounding format (*.usf*) files (ASCII). Both *.bin* and *.usf* files may contain several repetitions at one sounding site (runs).

The exact positions (datum: WGS84) of the four vertices of each square loop sounding are listed in the file *TEM2017.txt*. For convenience, we also include a GoogleEarth *.kml* file containing loop polygons and their respective centres.

## Financial support

Financial support for the data acquisition was provided by the UNAM (DGAPA-PAPIIT-IN107416 and IN105918). Matthias Bücker’s participation in this study was partly funded by a scholarship awarded  by the TU-Wien.

## Acknowledgements

Vianey Guadalupe Cruz Fitz, Ismerai Yazmín Reyes Corona, and Johannes Bücker assisted during the acquisition of TEM data in Xochimilco. We acknowledge the personnel of the Viveros de Netzahualcóyotl in Xochimilco without whose cooperation the realization of the field survey would not have been possible.
